# React Testing

- The purpose of this repo is to familiarize myself with the jest and enzyme testing libraries.
- There are a couple of create-react-app projects within this repo that I have done to practice setting up tests in different situations.
- Each test was set up in a TDD format with the test failing at first and passing in tne end to make sure the code was built as planned.
